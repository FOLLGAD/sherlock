# Sherlock - Your AI Home Assistant Chatbot üïµüèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è‚ö°Ô∏è

Sherlock is an open-source AI chatbot designed to automate tasks in your home using the power of GPT-3.5 by OpenAI. By interacting with Home Assistant through the Home Assistant REST API, Sherlock can control various smart home devices, execute bash commands, and even transcribe voice commands. The chatbot is accessible through Telegram and can perform online searches using the Google Search Serper API.

It can control specific devices without any hardcoding of `entity_ids` etc. It will match the user's query with the available entities on the network, and decide for itself which entity it thinks you mean. For example "turn of the living room lights" might turn off an entity called "light.big_living_room"
